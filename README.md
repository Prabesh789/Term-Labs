# üìò Terms-Labs: NLP & Text Mining Projects

This repository contains a series of hands-on lab assignments completed as part of my **Text Mining and Sentiment Analysis course** during the third term of my Business Analytics program. Each lab explores core concepts in Natural Language Processing (NLP), Machine Learning, and data-driven language analysis using Python.
